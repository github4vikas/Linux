Linu Booting Process : 

The Linux booting process involves several stages from the moment the computer is powered on to the point where the operating system is fully loaded and ready for use. Here’s a detailed overview of the Linux boot process:

1. BIOS/UEFI Stage
Power-On Self Test (POST): When the computer is powered on, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) performs a self-test to check the hardware components.
Boot Device Selection: After POST, the BIOS/UEFI looks for a bootable device (like a hard drive, SSD, or USB) based on the boot order configuration.
2. Boot Loader Stage
GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader): Once the boot device is found, the boot loader (commonly GRUB) is loaded into memory. GRUB provides a menu that allows users to select which operating system or kernel version to boot.
Kernel Loading: GRUB loads the selected Linux kernel into memory and passes control to it, along with any boot parameters specified.
3. Kernel Initialization
Kernel Uncompression: If the kernel is compressed, it is uncompressed in memory.
Hardware Detection: The kernel initializes hardware components, detecting devices and loading necessary drivers.
Mounting the Root Filesystem: The kernel mounts the root filesystem (typically defined in the boot loader configuration). This filesystem contains the necessary files for further system initialization.
4. Init Process
Starting the Init System: After the kernel initialization, it runs the init process (or its modern equivalents, such as systemd or upstart). This is the first user-space application and has PID 1.
Runlevel/Target Configuration: The init system reads configuration files (like /etc/inittab for traditional init or /etc/systemd/system/default.target for systemd) to determine which services and processes to start.
5. System Initialization
Starting Services: The init system starts system services and processes according to the defined runlevel or target. This may include:
Networking services
Display managers (for graphical interfaces)
Background services (daemons)
6. User Login
Login Prompt: Once the system has initialized the necessary services, a login prompt appears (either in a terminal or a graphical interface).
User Authentication: Users can log in using their credentials.
7. User Environment Setup
User Shell Initialization: After logging in, the user’s shell (like bash or zsh) is started, and the user's environment is set up (loading configuration files like .bashrc or .profile).
Summary
The Linux boot process can be summarized as follows:

BIOS/UEFI: Performs hardware checks and locates the boot device.
Boot Loader: Loads the kernel (usually GRUB).
Kernel Initialization: Initializes hardware and mounts the root filesystem.
Init Process: Starts the user-space init system (like systemd).
System Initialization: Boots services based on configuration.
User Login: Prompts for user credentials.
User Environment: Loads the user’s shell and environment settings.

Benfits of a Multiprocessor system :

Multiprocessor systems, which consist of two or more processors (CPUs) within a single computer system, offer several advantages over uniprocessor systems. Here are some key benefits:

1. Increased Performance
Parallel Processing: Multiple processors can execute instructions simultaneously, leading to higher overall throughput and faster execution of applications, especially those that are multithreaded or require intensive computation.
2. Improved Responsiveness
Concurrent Execution: Tasks can be divided among processors, allowing the system to handle multiple tasks concurrently, improving the responsiveness of applications and systems, especially in multi-user environments.
3. Enhanced Reliability and Availability
Redundancy: In some configurations, if one processor fails, the system can continue to operate using the remaining processors, enhancing system reliability.
Load Balancing: Workloads can be distributed across processors to prevent any single processor from becoming a bottleneck, improving system uptime.
4. Better Resource Utilization
Efficient Resource Sharing: Multiprocessor systems can share resources like memory and I/O devices more effectively, leading to better utilization of hardware resources.
5. Scalability
Easier Upgrades: Adding more processors to a multiprocessor system can often be done with minimal disruption, allowing for scalable performance improvements as demand grows.
6. Support for High-Performance Computing (HPC)
Scientific and Engineering Applications: Many scientific computations and simulations can be parallelized, significantly speeding up processing times in high-performance computing environments.
7. Improved Multitasking
Better Handling of Multiple Applications: The ability to run multiple processes simultaneously improves multitasking capabilities, making it ideal for servers and desktops that need to run many applications at once.
8. Reduced Latency
Faster Processing Times: By distributing tasks, multiprocessor systems can reduce the time it takes to process large data sets or perform complex calculations, leading to lower latency in applications.

what is RAID structure in OS and what are the different levels of raid configuration?


RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components into a single logical unit for improved performance, redundancy, or both. The operating system interacts with this logical unit as if it were a single disk.

Benefits of RAID
Improved Performance: By striping data across multiple disks, read and write speeds can be significantly enhanced.
Data Redundancy: Data can be mirrored or parity information can be stored to protect against disk failures.
Increased Storage Capacity: Multiple disks can be combined to form a larger logical volume.
Common RAID Levels
RAID configurations are defined by different "levels," each offering various balances of performance, data redundancy, and storage efficiency. Here are some of the most common RAID levels:

1. RAID 0 (Striping)
Description: Data is split into blocks and spread across multiple disks.
Performance: High read and write speeds.
Redundancy: No redundancy; if one disk fails, all data is lost.
Use Case: Suitable for performance-oriented applications where data loss is acceptable.
2. RAID 1 (Mirroring)
Description: Data is duplicated on two or more disks.
Performance: Good read speeds (can read from multiple disks), write speeds are slightly reduced.
Redundancy: High; data is safe as long as at least one disk is operational.
Use Case: Ideal for critical data where redundancy is important.
3. RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)
Description: Data and parity information are striped across three or more disks.
Performance: Good read speeds; write speeds can be slower due to parity calculations.
Redundancy: Can tolerate the failure of one disk without data loss.
Use Case: Suitable for environments needing a balance of performance and redundancy.
4. RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity)
Description: Similar to RAID 5, but with additional parity blocks.
Performance: Good read speeds; write speeds are slower due to double parity calculations.
Redundancy: Can tolerate the failure of up to two disks.
Use Case: Ideal for critical applications requiring higher fault tolerance.
5. RAID 10 (or RAID 1+0)
Description: Combines RAID 1 and RAID 0; data is mirrored and then striped.
Performance: High read and write speeds.
Redundancy: Can tolerate the failure of one disk in each mirrored pair.
Use Case: Suitable for high-performance applications with redundancy requirements.
6. RAID 2, 3, and 4
Description: Less commonly used levels that involve various forms of striping and dedicated parity disks.
Performance: Varies based on configuration.
Redundancy: Typically less efficient than the more commonly used RAID levels.
Summary of RAID Levels
Level	Description	Redundancy	Minimum Disks	Performance
RAID 0	Striping	None	2	High
RAID 1	Mirroring	Yes	2	Moderate
RAID 5	Striping with parity	Yes (1 disk failure)	3	Good
RAID 6	Striping with double parity	Yes (2 disk failures)	4	Good
RAID 10	Mirroring + Striping	Yes (1 per pair)	4	High

Paging Concept : 


Paging is a memory management scheme used in operating systems to eliminate the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory, thereby allowing efficient and flexible use of memory. Here’s an overview of the paging concept:

Key Concepts of Paging
Logical and Physical Memory:

Logical Memory: This is the address space that a program can use. It appears as a contiguous block of memory to the program.
Physical Memory: This refers to the actual RAM in the computer. Paging helps map logical addresses to physical addresses.
Pages and Frames:

Pages: The logical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called pages. The size is typically between 4 KB and 64 KB.
Frames: Physical memory is divided into blocks of the same size as pages, called frames. This ensures that any page can fit into any frame.
Page Table:

Each process has a page table that maintains the mapping between logical pages and physical frames. It contains the frame number for each page in logical memory.
Page Faults:

When a program tries to access a page that is not currently in physical memory (i.e., it's not loaded into a frame), a page fault occurs. The operating system then needs to load the required page from secondary storage (like a hard drive) into a free frame in physical memory.
Swapping:

If there are no free frames available, the operating system may need to swap out a page that is currently in memory to disk (usually the least recently used page) to make space for the new page.
Advantages of Paging
Eliminates Fragmentation:

Paging eliminates external fragmentation because physical memory is allocated in fixed-size frames.
Efficient Memory Use:

Programs can be loaded into any available memory location, allowing for more efficient use of RAM.
Isolation and Security:

Each process has its own page table, providing isolation between processes, enhancing security.
Simplified Memory Management:

The fixed-size pages make memory management simpler compared to variable-size segmentation.
Disadvantages of Paging
Internal Fragmentation:

Since pages are fixed in size, if a process doesn’t use the entire page, the unused space within that page leads to internal fragmentation.
Overhead of Page Tables:

Maintaining page tables for each process incurs additional memory overhead.
Page Fault Overhead:

Frequent page faults can lead to performance degradation due to the overhead of accessing the disk for pages that are not in memory.




Segmentation : 
Segmentation is a memory management technique that divides the logical address space of a process into variable-sized segments based on the logical structure of the program (e.g., functions, objects, arrays).


Both paging and segmentation are crucial for efficient memory management in modern operating systems. Paging simplifies memory allocation and reduces external fragmentation, while segmentation provides a more intuitive way to organize memory based on program structure. Some operating systems use a combination of both techniques (segmented paging) to leverage the advantages of each.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************



System Calls : 


System calls are the programming interface between an application and the operating system (OS). They provide a way for programs to request services from the kernel of the OS, allowing applications to interact with hardware, manage resources, and perform various system-level operations.

Key Features of System Calls
Interface to the Kernel: System calls serve as the primary means for user-level applications to access the services of the kernel, such as file manipulation, process control, and network communication.

Protected Access: They allow applications to request privileged operations that cannot be performed directly in user mode. The kernel ensures that these operations are performed safely and securely.

Standardized APIs: Operating systems provide a set of standardized system calls, often organized into libraries (like the POSIX standard), enabling portability across different systems.

Types of System Calls
System calls can be categorized into several types based on the operations they perform:

Process Control:

Manage processes (create, terminate, wait).
Examples: fork(), exec(), wait(), exit()
File Manipulation:

Create, open, read, write, and close files.
Examples: open(), read(), write(), close()
Device Management:

Interact with hardware devices (read/write to devices).
Examples: ioctl(), read(), write() (for device files)
Information Maintenance:

Retrieve or set system information (like time, system state).
Examples: getpid(), gettimeofday(), uname()
Communication:

Facilitate communication between processes, either on the same machine or over a network.
Examples: pipe(), shmget(), socket()
How System Calls Work
User Mode vs. Kernel Mode: Applications run in user mode, while the kernel operates in kernel mode. To perform a system call, the application must switch from user mode to kernel mode.

Invocation: When a program makes a system call, it typically does so via a library function that encapsulates the low-level details of the call.

Context Switching: The CPU context is switched from the user program to the kernel. This involves saving the state of the user program and loading the kernel state.

Execution: The kernel performs the requested operation, accessing hardware or managing resources as necessary.

Return to User Mode: After the operation is complete, control is returned to the user application, along with any results or status codes.


***********************************************************************************************************************************



Process Lifecycle : 


The process lifecycle describes the various states a process goes through from its creation to its termination. Understanding these states is crucial for grasping how operating systems manage processes. Here’s a breakdown of the process lifecycle and the states involved.

Process States
New (or Created):

Description: The process is being created. It has been allocated memory and resources but has not yet started execution.
Transition: Moves to the Ready state when the process is loaded into memory and ready to run.
Ready:

Description: The process is waiting for CPU time. It is in memory and ready to execute but is not currently running because other processes are using the CPU.
Transition: Moves to the Running state when the CPU scheduler selects it for execution.
Running:

Description: The process is actively executing on the CPU. It has access to the CPU and is performing its tasks.
Transition:
Moves to the Waiting state if it needs to wait for some event (like I/O completion).
Moves back to the Ready state if it is preempted by the scheduler (to allow another process to run).
Waiting (or Blocked):

Description: The process cannot continue executing because it is waiting for some event (e.g., I/O operation, resource availability).
Transition: Moves back to the Ready state once the event it is waiting for occurs.
Terminated (or Exit):

Description: The process has finished execution and is being removed from memory. Resources allocated to the process are released.
Transition: The process cannot move to any other state after termination.



*************************************************************************************************************************



fork()

The fork() system call is a crucial mechanism in Unix-like operating systems that allows a process to create a new child process. It is foundational for multitasking and process management, enabling applications to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. 


********************************************************************************************************************************************************************



Multitasking vs Multiprocessing : 


Multitasking
Definition:

Multitasking refers to the ability of an operating system to execute multiple tasks (processes or threads) concurrently. It allows a single CPU to switch between tasks efficiently.
Execution:

In multitasking, a single processor manages multiple tasks by rapidly switching between them, giving the illusion that they are running simultaneously. This is achieved through context switching.



Multiprocessing
Definition:

Multiprocessing refers to the use of two or more CPUs (or cores) within a single computer to execute multiple processes simultaneously.
Execution:

In multiprocessing, multiple processes run at the same time on different processors. Each processor can handle its own task independently, improving performance and efficiency.


Feature	 - Multitasking --	Multiprocessing
Definition - 	Execution of multiple tasks on one CPU --	Execution of multiple processes on multiple CPUs
Execution	 - Concurrent switching between tasks -- 	Simultaneous execution of tasks
Types - 	Cooperative and preemptive	-- SMP and AMP
Resource -  Sharing	Tasks share the same CPU and resources -- 	Each process may have its own CPU and resources
Performance - 	Limited by a single CPU’s performance -- 	Improved performance with multiple CPUs


***********************************************************************************************************************************************



CPU vs Cores : 


The terms "CPU" and "cores" are often used interchangeably, but they refer to different concepts in computer architecture. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

CPU (Central Processing Unit)
Definition:

The CPU, often referred to as the processor, is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside a computer. It executes instructions from programs, performs calculations, and manages data flow within the system.
Structure:

A CPU typically consists of one or more cores, along with other components such as cache memory and control units. Modern CPUs can contain multiple cores, which allow them to perform more tasks simultaneously.
Functionality:

The CPU handles all types of processing tasks, including arithmetic calculations, logic operations, and input/output (I/O) operations. It is responsible for interpreting and executing instructions from computer programs.
Cores
Definition:

A core is a single processing unit within a CPU. Each core can independently execute tasks and instructions, meaning that a multicore CPU can handle multiple operations at the same time.
Multicore Processors:

Modern CPUs often have multiple cores (dual-core, quad-core, octa-core, etc.), which enables them to perform parallel processing. For example, a quad-core CPU can run four threads simultaneously.
Performance:

The number of cores in a CPU significantly affects its performance, especially for multitasking and multithreaded applications. More cores can improve performance in applications designed to take advantage of parallel processing, such as video editing, gaming, and scientific simulations.
Summary of Differences
Feature	CPU (Central Processing Unit)	Cores
Definition	The main processing unit of a computer	- Individual processing units within a CPU
Structure	May contain one or more cores - 	Represents a single processing unit
Functionality	Executes all types of instructions - 	Executes tasks independently
Performance	Overall performance is influenced by cores - 	More cores generally improve multitasking and parallel processing capabilities

Scheduling Alogorithm : 


A scheduling algorithm is a method used by an operating system to allocate CPU time to various processes or threads in order to optimize system performance, responsiveness, and resource utilization. Scheduling algorithms determine the order in which processes are executed and can significantly affect system efficiency and user experience.

Key Objectives of Scheduling Algorithms
Maximize CPU Utilization: Keep the CPU as busy as possible to improve throughput.
Minimize Wait Time: Reduce the amount of time processes spend waiting in the queue.
Minimize Turnaround Time: Decrease the total time taken for a process to complete from submission to completion.
Minimize Response Time: Ensure that the time taken to respond to a user’s request is minimized, especially in interactive systems.
Fairness: Ensure that all processes get a fair share of the CPU without starvation.
Types of Scheduling Algorithms
First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):

Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive.
Simple but can lead to long wait times, especially with long processes (convoy effect).
Shortest Job Next (SJN) or Shortest Job First (SJF):

The process with the smallest execution time is scheduled next.
Can minimize average wait time but may lead to starvation of longer processes.
Priority Scheduling:

Each process is assigned a priority, and the CPU is allocated to the highest-priority process.
Can lead to starvation if low-priority processes are perpetually preempted.
Round Robin (RR):

Each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum). When the time slice expires, the process is placed at the end of the queue.
Fair and responsive, but overhead can increase with many context switches.
Multilevel Queue Scheduling:

Processes are divided into multiple queues based on priority or other criteria. Each queue can have its own scheduling algorithm.
Provides flexibility but can be complex to manage.
Multilevel Feedback Queue:

Similar to multilevel queue scheduling, but processes can move between queues based on their behavior and requirements (e.g., using CPU time).


*************************************************************************************************************************************************************


what is a process : 

a process is a running instance of a program that consists of the program's code, its current activity, and its allocated resources.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************


Threads in OS : 

A thread is a lightweight process and the smallest unit of execution within a process in an operating system. Threads allow a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, enabling better resource utilization and improved performance.

****************************************************************************************************************************


Inodes : 

Inodes (index nodes) are critical data structures in Unix-like file systems that store metadata about files and directories. They play a vital role in managing and organizing the file system.

*******************************************************************************************************************************


Cache : 

A cache is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. Caches are used to reduce latency and improve performance by storing frequently accessed information in a location that can be accessed more quickly than the original source.

Key Characteristics of Caches
Speed: Caches are typically faster than the primary data source (like main memory or a database).
Temporary Storage: Caches store a subset of data that is expected to be reused.
Hierarchical: Caches often exist in multiple layers (e.g., CPU cache levels) to optimize access speed.
Types of Caches
CPU Cache:

L1 Cache: The smallest and fastest cache, located closest to the CPU core. It typically stores the most frequently accessed data and instructions.
L2 Cache: Larger than L1 but slower. It acts as a secondary cache to store additional data and instructions that may not fit in L1.
L3 Cache: Shared among multiple CPU cores, larger than L2, and used to reduce latency when data is not found in L1 or L2 caches.
Disk Cache:

A cache that stores frequently accessed data from disk drives in faster storage (like RAM) to speed up read and write operations. This can include:
File System Cache: Caches files and metadata for quicker access.
Block Cache: Caches blocks of data from disk storage.
Web Cache:

Stores copies of web resources (like HTML pages, images) to reduce load times and server bandwidth usage. Types include:
Browser Cache: Stores web pages and resources locally on a user's device.
Proxy Cache: Caches content between users and servers to reduce redundancy in requests.
Application Cache:

Used in applications to store frequently accessed data or results from expensive operations (like database queries) to speed up performance. Examples include:
Memory Caches: Like Redis or Memcached, storing data in memory for quick access.
Local Storage: In web applications, for storing user preferences or session data.
Database Cache:

Caches the results of database queries to speed up subsequent queries. This can involve:
Query Caching: Storing results of queries.
Object Caching: Storing objects or data structures in memory.

***********************************************************************************************************



Network Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network or communication channel in a given period of time, typically measured in bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (Kbps), megabits per second (Mbps), or gigabits per second (Gbps).. 
Throughput refers to the actual amount of data that is transmitted over a network or communication channel in a given period of time.
Latency is the time it takes for data to travel from the source to the destination. It is typically measured in milliseconds (ms) and can include several components, such as propagation delay, transmission delay, and processing delay.




*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************



Zombie Process : 

A zombie process is a process in a Unix or Linux operating system that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table. This occurs when a child process terminates, but its parent process has not yet read its exit status using a system call like wait(). Here's a deeper look into the concept:

Key Characteristics of a Zombie Process
Termination State:

A zombie process is in a terminated state, meaning it has finished executing. However, it still occupies an entry in the process table to allow the parent process to retrieve its exit status.
Resource Usage:

Zombie processes do not consume system resources such as CPU or memory. They do occupy a small amount of space in the process table until they are completely removed.
Identifiable:

Zombie processes can be identified by their status, which is usually indicated by the letter "Z" in the output of commands like ps or top.

Causes of Zombie Processes
Parent Not Handling Termination: If the parent process does not call wait() or is programmed incorrectly to handle the termination of its child processes, zombies can accumulate.
Parent Process Termination: If a parent process terminates before it has a chance to call wait(), the child processes may become orphaned. The init process (PID 1) then adopts them and cleans up after them, avoiding zombies.

Implications
Process Table Limit: Each zombie process occupies a slot in the process table, which has a finite number of entries. If too many zombie processes accumulate, they can exhaust the available process table slots, preventing new processes from being created.
Management: Zombie processes are usually harmless but should be cleaned up to maintain system efficiency. If a parent is not designed to handle child processes correctly, it may require fixing.




*******************************************************************************************************************************************************



Thrashing in OS : 


Thrashing in an operating system occurs when a system spends more time swapping pages in and out of memory than executing actual processes. This can lead to a significant degradation in system performance, as the CPU is essentially "busy" managing memory instead of executing user applications.

Causes of Thrashing
Insufficient Physical Memory:

When the physical memory (RAM) is not enough to hold all the processes and their active pages, the operating system has to frequently swap pages to and from disk.
High Degree of Multiprogramming:

Running too many processes simultaneously can increase the demand for memory beyond what is physically available, leading to thrashing.
Working Set Model:

Each process has a working set, which is the set of pages that it needs to access frequently. If the working set of multiple processes exceeds the available physical memory, thrashing can occur.
Page Faults:

High page fault rates can trigger thrashing. If processes are continually accessing pages that are not in memory, the system will spend a lot of time handling page faults.
Symptoms of Thrashing
High Disk Activity: Increased read and write operations on the disk as pages are swapped in and out.
Poor Performance: Applications become sluggish, with significant delays in response times.
CPU Utilization Drops: Despite high levels of activity (due to paging), the CPU utilization can drop as processes spend most of their time waiting for pages to be loaded.
Prevention and Solutions
Increase Physical Memory: Adding more RAM can alleviate thrashing by providing more space for active pages.

Reduce Multiprogramming: Limiting the number of concurrently running processes can help ensure that the working sets fit within physical memory.

Adjust Page Replacement Algorithms: Implementing smarter algorithms that take working sets into account can help minimize thrashing. For example, using a Least Recently Used (LRU) strategy can improve performance.

Working Set Management: Monitoring and managing the working sets of processes to ensure that the most frequently used pages remain in memory can help reduce thrashing.

Using Locality of Reference: Ensuring that programs are designed to use data and instructions in a localized manner can help improve memory usage and reduce page faults.


**********************************************************************************************************************************************


starvation and aging in OS : 

 Starvation occurs when a process is perpetually denied the resources it needs to proceed, often because other processes are continually being prioritized over it. This can happen in scheduling algorithms that favor certain processes, leading to situations where low-priority processes may never get executed.

Aging is a technique used to prevent starvation by gradually increasing the priority of waiting processes over time. As a process waits longer in the queue, its priority is incrementally increased to ensure it eventually receives the resources it needs.



****************************************************************************************************************************************


not able to ssh into ec2 using pem file : 


If you're having trouble SSH-ing into an AWS EC2 instance using a PEM file, here are several steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check Permissions of the PEM File
Make sure the permissions on your PEM file are set correctly. The file should be readable only by you:

chmod 400 /path/to/your-key.pem

2. Verify the Instance State
Ensure that your EC2 instance is running. You can check the instance status in the AWS Management Console.

3. Use the Correct User
Depending on the AMI you are using, the default username may vary:

Amazon Linux: ec2-user
Ubuntu: ubuntu
CentOS: centos
RHEL: ec2-user or root
Debian: admin or root
Example SSH command:


ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns


4. Check Security Group Settings
Ensure that the security group associated with your EC2 instance allows inbound SSH traffic (port 22):

Go to the EC2 dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
Click on "Instances" and select your instance.
In the description section, find the security group and click on it.
Under the "Inbound rules" tab, check that there is a rule allowing SSH (port 22) from your IP address.

5. Check Network Access Control List (NACL)
If you're using a VPC, make sure that the NACLs associated with your subnet allow inbound and outbound traffic on port 22.

6. Verify Public IP/DNS
Ensure you're using the correct public IP address or public DNS name for the instance. You can find this information in the AWS Management Console under the "Instances" section.

7. Check Instance Reachability
Make sure there are no issues preventing you from reaching the instance:

Check if you can ping the instance’s public IP.
Ensure your local firewall or network settings aren’t blocking outgoing SSH connections.
8. Check for Instance-Level Firewall
If you have configured any firewalls on the EC2 instance (like iptables or firewalld), ensure they are not blocking SSH connections.

9. Review the PEM File and Instance Pairing
Make sure you are using the correct PEM file that corresponds to the key pair used to launch the instance.

10. Use EC2 Instance Connect (if applicable)
If you're using Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu, you can use EC2 Instance Connect as an alternative to SSH with a PEM file. This requires the instance to have a proper IAM policy.
